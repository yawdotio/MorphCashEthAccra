## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **ENS Authentication**: Verify ENS ownership and create profiles
- **Email/Password**: Traditional authentication with secure storage
- **Wallet Connection**: Manual wallet connection (no auto-connect)

### Virtual Card System
- **System-Generated Details**: Automatic card number, expiry date, and type generation
- **Fee Management**: 0.02% funding fee calculation
- **Card Management**: Create, edit, and deactivate virtual cards

### Smart Contracts
- **YourContract.sol**: Main contract managing ENS profiles and virtual cards
- **OpenZeppelin Integration**: Security and access control

## Usage

1. **Authentication**: 
   - Connect wallet or sign in with ENS/email
   - ENS users can create profiles with metadata

2. **Virtual Cards**:
   - Navigate to Dashboard > Cards
   - Create new virtual cards with funding amounts
   - System generates card details automatically
   - Manage existing cards (edit, deactivate)

3. **Profile Management**:
   - Update ENS profile information
   - Manage authentication methods

## Security Features

- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **ENS Verification**: Real ownership verification for ENS names
- **Smart Contract Security**: OpenZeppelin security patterns
- **No Auto-Connect**: Manual wallet connection for better security
