# Smart Contract Refactor: Blockchain-Only Payments

## Overview

The PaymentContract has been refactored to focus exclusively on blockchain-based payments (ENS/connected wallets) and emit events for frontend handling of Supabase integration. This addresses the architectural issue where smart contracts cannot make external API calls to Supabase.

## Key Changes

### 1. PaymentContract Refactor

**Before:**
- Handled both mobile money and crypto payments
- Had complex verification and processing logic
- Attempted to integrate with external systems

**After:**
- Focuses only on blockchain payments (ETH)
- Simplified to handle card funding with immediate processing
- Emits events for frontend to handle Supabase integration

### 2. New Contract Structure

#### CardFunding Struct
```solidity
struct CardFunding {
    uint256 fundingId;
    address user;
    uint256 amount; // Amount in wei (ETH)
    uint256 ghsAmount; // Amount in GHS (for reference)
    string cardType; // Visa, Mastercard, etc.
    string paymentReference;
    string transactionHash;
    bool isProcessed;
    uint256 createdAt;
}
```

#### Key Functions
- `fundCard(ghsAmount, cardType, paymentReference)` - Main function for funding cards with ETH
- `setFundingLimits(min, max)` - Owner function to set funding limits
- `withdraw(amount)` - Owner function to withdraw contract balance
- `getCardFunding(fundingId)` - Get funding details by ID

#### Events
- `CardFundingInitiated` - Emitted when funding starts
- `CardFundingSuccess` - Emitted when funding is successful
- `CardFundingFailed` - Emitted when funding fails

### 3. Frontend Integration

#### CardFundingListener Component
- Listens to `CardFundingSuccess` events
- Automatically creates virtual cards in Supabase when funding succeeds
- Handles the bridge between blockchain events and database operations

#### CryptoCardFunding Component
- Provides UI for users to fund cards with crypto
- Uses the new `fundCard` function
- Integrates with the event listener for automatic card creation

## Architecture Flow

1. **User initiates funding** via CryptoCardFunding component
2. **Smart contract processes payment** and emits CardFundingSuccess event
3. **CardFundingListener** catches the event
4. **Supabase card creation** happens automatically in the frontend
5. **User receives** their virtual card

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Smart contracts handle only blockchain logic
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Frontend responds to blockchain events
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new payment methods without contract changes
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between blockchain and database logic
5. **Security**: No external API calls from smart contracts

## Usage Example

```typescript
// In your component
import { CardFundingListener } from './CardFundingListener';
import { CryptoCardFunding } from './CryptoCardFunding';

export const CardManagement = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <CardFundingListener /> {/* Listens to events */}
      <CryptoCardFunding 
        onSuccess={() => console.log('Card funded!')}
        onError={(error) => console.error('Error:', error)}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Migration Notes

- Old payment verification functions have been removed
- New funding limits are set (0.001 ETH minimum, 10 ETH maximum)
- All Supabase integration moved to frontend
- Event-driven architecture replaces direct database calls

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated PaymentContract
2. Update frontend components to use new funding flow
3. Test the event-driven card creation process
4. Add additional payment methods (MTN Mobile Money) as frontend-only features
